# airbnb2
An extension of the inclass Airbnb example, utilizing JS to create multiple listings.

Compared to the inclass example walkthrough, this version uses AJAX (JS fetch and wait) to read in a JSON file and slice through the first 50 listings for output. 
A template is developed within the HTML to outline the general format for each listing with some minor styling noted within the CSS.
